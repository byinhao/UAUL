overall this is a good system for the price and i do recommend the ssd for the price .	5,6 OS#PRICE 2 4,5	14,15 HARD_DISC#PRICE 2 12,13
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .	10,11 FANS&COOLING#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 3,4
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .	2,3 COMPANY#GENERAL 2 1,2	7,8 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 6,7
