you know , i wanted to love this machine .	8,9 LAPTOP#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of android apps from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .	11,13 SOFTWARE#USABILITY 0 -1,-1

initially the product lived up to the expectations .	2,3 LAPTOP#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
there were challenges with the chromebook specific apps and the google play store apps worked sometimes , but most of them had the size issue where they are only the size of a phone screen .	5,8 SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 -1,-1	10,14 SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 -1,-1
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#QUALITY 0 3,4	41,43 DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 -1,-1
also the case design is sort of rounded at both sides - a minor issue but it makes the device pop open in my purse and detracts from the ` ` feel ` ` of the device by making it feel a lot thicker than it actually is .	2,3 HARDWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 -1,-1

google is very concerned about arc to chromeos connections for security , etc etc .	0,1 COMPANY#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
the rub is that chromeos itself is so limited in functionality that it is probably the most secure os platform out there .	4,5 OS#GENERAL 0 -1,-1

samsung sent me a new stylus free of charge and free of hassle , which was nice of them because the top of the oem stylus popped off one day and could not be reassembled .	25,26 HARDWARE#GENERAL 2 16,17	24,26 HARDWARE#GENERAL 0 -1,-1
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .	1,2 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 -1,-1
the bottom plastic piece - this is not a unibody machine - will be too hot to rest on bare skin .	2,4 HARDWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 -1,-1
i can not explain why , except to think that there is something wrong with the voltage wiring and the left channel is exceeding design capacity .	16,17 PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 -1,-1
the left charging port does not always make full contact with the charger and so sometimes the usb c charger is plugged in and slightly awry and therefore not charging .	2,4 PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 -1,-1	17,19 PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 -1,-1

many of acer ' s chromebooks have , historically , been hampered by their poor displays .	15,16 DISPLAY#GENERAL 0 14,15
the chromebook 14 has a 1080p ips display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness .	7,8 DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 9,10	7,8 DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 13,14

a more recent trend among chrome os devices is the inclusion of 4gb of ram and 32gb of storage , instead of the 2gb / 16gb to which we ' ve become accustomed .	5,8 MEMORY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 1 -1,-1
the extra ram , however , is great for everyone , as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs , or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content , without tabs crashing out or caching / reloading .	2,3 MEMORY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 7,8
the screen is great , for both media consumption and general computing / web browsing ; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the intel processor and 4gb of ram , and it looks sharp , thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials .	1,2 DISPLAY#GENERAL 2 3,4	-1,-1 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 39,40	23,24 MEMORY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 19,20	29,31 CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 25,26

it also has pretty decent i / o with two usb 3 .	5,8 PORTS#CONNECTIVITY 2 4,5
i can ' t help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the n3160 .	18,19 CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 12,13
it is solid , and does a decent job rendering pages , and paired with the extra ram here , it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as youtube or spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs ;	-1,-1 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 2,3	-1,-1 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 39,40	-1,-1 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 -1,-1
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !	5,8 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 20,21
i led with those first five points for a reason : being able to purchase a decently - performing chromebook with aluminum build , a 1080p ips display , 4gb of ram , 32gb of local storage , and an intel quad - core processor for $ 299 is basically what the entirely of the chromeos subreddit has been asking for over the past few years .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS 2 16,17
5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price , the absence of a touchscreen upgrade , or the use of slower emmc storage instead of a real m .	24,26 MEMORY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 23,24
these are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4 .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 -1,-1
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .	0,1 COMPANY#GENERAL 2 -1,-1

i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system , adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me , so while disappointed in the new upgrades , this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $ .	41,44 SOFTWARE#USABILITY 0 39,40

therefore , my advice to you if you ' re a student and you need a laptop for school , this laptop is the best choice for you .	16,17 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 24,25
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .	8,9 OS#USABILITY 2 30,32

the key board is one of the best i ' ve ever typed on .	1,3 KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 7,8
this is my first ever macbook and i will never go back .	5,6 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 -1,-1
i think the mbp ticks off more of the nice - to - have boxes for me than the xps13 overall .	3,4 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 -1,-1
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .	1,2 LAPTOP#QUALITY 1 -1,-1
the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ) .	1,3 BATTERY#GENERAL 2 6,7
the trackpad is the ultimate difference - maker for me .	1,2 KEYBOARD#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .	1,3 KEYBOARD#GENERAL 2 4,5
the mbp 13 ` ` is plenty mobile .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#PORTABILITY 2 -1,-1
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .	11,12 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 2,3	34,38 SOFTWARE#GENERAL 1 -1,-1	41,42 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 0 -1,-1
adobe apps are also power hogs , but that is to be expected .	0,2 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 1 -1,-1
i also feel like apple hides too much under the hood from the user , but i suppose you can still work around that if you are so inclined .	4,5 COMPANY#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
an unexpected benefit for me has been the iphone / mbp integration .	8,12 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 2,3
i love the airdrop and receiving imessages on my mbp ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .	3,4 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 1,2	-1,-1 SOFTWARE#GENERAL 1 -1,-1
overall , it ' s a great machine .	7,8 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 6,7
it ' ll be interesting to see what the revisions are in 2016 , but i was worried about the shallow keys of the new macbook making their way to the mbp and the loss of port options with a new revision , so i am very happy to have this now .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 47,48

this was a outstanding upgrade from the early 2013 650m model .	-1,-1 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 3,4
as far as gaming performance , the m370x does quite well .	7,8 GRAPHICS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 10,11
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .	21,22 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 24,25
with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .	18,19 LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 15,16
nothing beats the quality of the mac os x as well , which is one of the main reasons for this purchase .	6,9 OS#GENERAL 2 -1,-1

the surface texture of the case is a satiny paper - like touch , which is both clean and easy to wipe down , but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it .	1,6 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 17,18	1,6 LAPTOP#USABILITY 2 19,20
even with the 2 - in - 1 flip hinge , the device has a solid feel and there ' s very little wobble in the screen while typing .	26,27 DISPLAY#USABILITY 2 -1,-1

one place that does frustrate me in the tablet mode is that chromeos has a number of ui features that don ' t lend themselves to touch interaction .	12,13 OS#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 4,5
it has a glassy - smooth surface that resists finger - prints and goop , is very large , and has a firm but not too - clunky feeling click to it .	6,7 DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 3,4	6,7 DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 5,6	6,7 DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 17,18	6,7 DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES 2 22,23

performance - wise , i can easily have 12 - 24 tabs open simultaneously and see no slow - down in performance .	-1,-1 OS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE 2 -1,-1
one place that i find lacking in chromeos is the settings management .	7,8 OS#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 -1,-1
for the most - part you don ' t have much freedom to make any significant changes to settings .	-1,-1 SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES 0 -1,-1

so , this is where this little chromebook really shines .	7,8 LAPTOP#GENERAL 2 9,10
apps start very fast , graphics are much more responsive and capable when not being shared with chromeos and there are a number of ways you can tweak the ui / ux to your own liking .	5,6 GRAPHICS#USABILITY 2 9,10	5,6 GRAPHICS#USABILITY 2 11,12
all that being said , you get a lot of bang for the buck with these three enhanced desktop / application options and i use all three in some capacity every day , so don ' t think your ' e isolated to just one approach .	18,22 SOFTWARE#GENERAL 2 -1,-1
while the stock aluminum case is darn solid enough , it can take scratches easily from things like keys or cable connectors tossed in a bag with it .	2,5 LAPTOP#QUALITY 2 7,8
