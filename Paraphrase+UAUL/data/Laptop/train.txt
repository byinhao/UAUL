reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####[['NULL', 'laptop quality', 'negative', 'terrible'], ['touch screen', 'display operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]

a more recent trend among chrome os devices is the inclusion of 4gb of ram and 32gb of storage , instead of the 2gb / 16gb to which we ' ve become accustomed .####[['chrome os devices', 'memory operation_performance', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
the extra ram , however , is great for everyone , as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs , or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content , without tabs crashing out or caching / reloading .####[['ram', 'memory operation_performance', 'positive', 'great']]
the screen is great , for both media consumption and general computing / web browsing ; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the intel processor and 4gb of ram , and it looks sharp , thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials .####[['screen', 'display general', 'positive', 'great'], ['NULL', 'laptop design_features', 'positive', 'sharp'], ['storage', 'memory operation_performance', 'positive', 'nice'], ['intel processor', 'cpu operation_performance', 'positive', 'solid']]

the acer is very nice , to be sure , especially considering the price or $ 299 .####[['acer', 'laptop price', 'positive', 'nice']]
it also has pretty decent i / o with two usb 3 .####[['i / o', 'ports connectivity', 'positive', 'decent']]
i can ' t help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the n3160 .####[['n3160', 'cpu operation_performance', 'negative', 'exaggerating']]
it is solid , and does a decent job rendering pages , and paired with the extra ram here , it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as youtube or spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs ;####[['NULL', 'laptop operation_performance', 'positive', 'solid'], ['NULL', 'laptop operation_performance', 'positive', 'decent'], ['NULL', 'laptop operation_performance', 'positive', 'NULL']]
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####[['acer chromebook 14', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'excellent']]
i led with those first five points for a reason : being able to purchase a decently - performing chromebook with aluminum build , a 1080p ips display , 4gb of ram , 32gb of local storage , and an intel quad - core processor for $ 299 is basically what the entirely of the chromeos subreddit has been asking for over the past few years .####[['NULL', 'laptop miscellaneous', 'positive', 'decently']]
5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price , the absence of a touchscreen upgrade , or the use of slower emmc storage instead of a real m .####[['emmc storage', 'memory operation_performance', 'negative', 'slower']]
these are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4 .####[['NULL', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####[['acer', 'company general', 'positive', 'NULL']]

i think the mbp ticks off more of the nice - to - have boxes for me than the xps13 overall .####[['mbp', 'laptop design_features', 'positive', 'NULL']]
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####[['mbp', 'laptop quality', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ) .####[['battery life', 'battery general', 'positive', 'comparable']]
the trackpad is the ultimate difference - maker for me .####[['trackpad', 'keyboard general', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .####[['mbp trackpad', 'keyboard general', 'positive', 'best']]
the mbp 13 ` ` is plenty mobile .####[['NULL', 'laptop portability', 'positive', 'NULL']]
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####[['apps', 'software operation_performance', 'negative', 'drawback'], ['google docs / drive', 'software general', 'neutral', 'NULL'], ['chrome', 'software operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
adobe apps are also power hogs , but that is to be expected .####[['adobe apps', 'software operation_performance', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
i also feel like apple hides too much under the hood from the user , but i suppose you can still work around that if you are so inclined .####[['apple', 'company general', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
an unexpected benefit for me has been the iphone / mbp integration .####[['iphone / mbp integration', 'laptop design_features', 'positive', 'benefit']]
i love the airdrop and receiving imessages on my mbp ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .####[['airdrop', 'software operation_performance', 'positive', 'love'], ['NULL', 'software general', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
overall , it ' s a great machine .####[['machine', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'great']]
it ' ll be interesting to see what the revisions are in 2016 , but i was worried about the shallow keys of the new macbook making their way to the mbp and the loss of port options with a new revision , so i am very happy to have this now .####[['NULL', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'happy']]
